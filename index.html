        </p> what is a nucleus? </p>
        </p> A nucleus acts as the control center of the cell. It regulates the cell growth and reproduction. 
        The nucleus contains structerescalled chromosomes.
        Chromosomes contain the cell genes, which determine the characteristic of the cell.</p>
        </p> How does a nucleus work</p>
        </p> By housing the cell's genome,the nucleus serves both as the repository of genetic information and as the
        cell's control center. DNA replication,transcription, and RNA
             processing all take place within the nucleus, with only the final stage of gene expression localized to the cytoplasm.</p>
        </p> What is the nucleus cell structure look like</p> 
        </p> the nucleus is like a brain, helping and controlling the cell move,absorb nutrients, and create new cells
        surrounded by cytoplasm which is like a jelly-like fluid that 
             fills the empty space in the cell, the nucleus is made up of many parts including the nucleus membrane. 
        It is a two layered structure that protects the nucleus.
        </p> the nucleolus is the distinct structure Present in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.
             primarily, it participates in assembling the ribosomes, alteration of transfer Rna and, sensing cellular stress. 
        the nucleus is composed of RNA and proteins,which
             form around specific chromosomal regions.
